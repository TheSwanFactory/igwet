=== Problems to be Solved (PS)

. We the Datocracy Committee need to align around the 'Datocratic Principles' (DP) we intend to promote

. The initial Principles should be simple enough it can be used to manually evaluate our initial decisions

. The Principles should be complete and aspirational enough to guide and inspire future evolution

=== We Should (WS)

. Adopt the following Four Principles:

.. Consider all Relevant Data
.. Make Decisions Transparently and Inclusively
.. Measure Impact Numerically
.. Capture Learning for Future Improvement

. Ask these two Yes/No questions before and after approving each Datocratic Decision:

.. Do you feel your values were taken into consideration when this decision was made?
.. Do you feel we have enough of a system in place to track the results of this decision and learn from them?
