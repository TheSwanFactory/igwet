- v1.0, 2020-08-01 Ernest Prabhakar <admin+operator@igwet.com>

== USAGE

- WHEN there does not seem to be any honorable way forward,
- TRY denying Self to encounter Christ through His Cross
- SO THAT we and our reality can be transformed in His image

== DETAILS

Communities that survive require mechanisms bridge the gap between short-term self-interest and the long-term needs of the community. The most powerful such mechanism is code of honor that members internalize as core to their identity.
