= About the "Practice" Subfolder

This file contains AsciiDoc source code for the IGWET.com Relational Practices (RPs).

The current plan is to statically generate HTML using asciidoctor, and then use index.js to display them under igwet.com/practice.

While we would eventually like to have a proper GUI for non-technical users to create and edit RPs, our priority is to embed these in a fully public, irrevocable, and easily forkable format.
A GitHub repository satisfied those constraints, but an internal database does not.
The ultimate solution way well involve some sort of blockchain coupled with the Fediverse distributed authentication system.
