Intra-Group Web/Email/Text Network Messaging Directory

IGWET is an inside-out social network designed to facilitate external relationships.  Our initial product is a *secure messaging directory* for churches, conferences, singles groups, and other communities that want an easy yet safe way for members to connect around shared interests without having to share sensitive personal information.

IGWET is written in Elixir using the Phoenix web application framework.
